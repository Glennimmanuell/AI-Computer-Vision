"This is my first Computer Vision project, utilizing the Raspberry Pi 5. However, feel free to choose another Single Board Computer (SBC) or mini PC if you prefer. In the 'LED control' file, I have integrated both software and hardware components. Specifically, when the index finger is opened, LED1 is activated, and so forth.

Presequirities:

Install the Mediapipe framework.
Install the GPIOzero library for GPIO control.
Install the OpenCV Python library."
